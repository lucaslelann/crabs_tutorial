# Add a Gather Step

Some calculations require data to be in a long format to work.

In this section we perform a gathering of the Principal Components.

by gathering the principal components we can then use them in a block for a visualization

This gather is done so a multi-pairwise comparison can be done with the PCA results.

\

The gather step is now configured.
