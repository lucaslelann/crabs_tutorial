# Running a PCA

In this section you perform a PCA on the data.

The projection you created in the previous section can also be used by a computation (i.e. __operator__).

This is due to the _What you see is what you compute_ paradigm. 

First we add the PCA operator.

Continue in the projection we created in the previous chapter.

The operators in every step can also be activated from the workflow page by right clicking on the data step and selecting `Run`
The the data step status is indicated by the color on the top right corner, red means not activated and green means activated.

* Right click on the data step and select `Rename`

* Always name the steps descriptive to keep a clear workflow. 
* Rename to "PCA"

The steps in the workflow can be dragged to your liking. Try to keep your workflow easily interpretable.

* Drag the "PCA" step around

* Save the entire workflow by clicking on the save icon

You have computed a PCA on the data. In the upcoming sections we take a look at the results of the PCA.
