# Learning Objectives

\

In this tutorial you will learn how to conduct a research project on __Tercen__.

This step-by-step guide outlines how to upload, view, compute, and share data on __Tercen__.

In our training scenario we will use a multivariate data set of morphological  _measurements_ of two species of _Leptograpsus Crabs_ 

We will apply the PCA (Principle Component Analysis) Operator to analyse this data. 

\

The following steps are covered:

* Create a project __team__
* Add the PCA Operator
* Create a __Project__ 
* __Upload__ the crabs dataset 
* Build an analysis __workflow__ 
* __Calculate__ data with PCA
* Use the __outputs__ of the previous calculations in new workflow steps
* Gather
* __Export__ the results

\

\

Our example data set of morphological  measurements of two species of Leptograpsus Crabs was collected at Fremantle, W. Australia.
