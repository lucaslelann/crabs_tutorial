Tercen accepts data in the following file types. File Description .tsv Tab sperated values .csv Comma seperated values Data can be uploaded in either wide format or long format. Most people work in a Wide data format. Usually with samples in rows and individual measurements in columns. This is the most typical way we use spreadsheet programs. For large data sets, with many multiples of measurement criteria, this can become unwieldy. It is often necessary to convert from a more “people friendly” wide format to a more “machine friendly” long format. Tercen works in long format and will convert wide data as part of the upload process. 5.1 About the exmple data. The example data set is available online in a Tercen github repository. Right click on this link –&gt; Sample File and select Save link as... This will download a file to your computer called crabs_long.csv Crab data description: The data set is called “Crabs” and it is in a long format. The file contains 1000 measurements of crab physical traits. Data is recorded under six headings called factors. Factor Description sp species, B (Blue Crab) or O (Orange Crab) sex M (Male) or F (Female) index index 1 to 50 within each of the four groups (2 sex and 2 species) variable Five crab physical traits can be measured FL, RW, CL, CW and BD measurement the value in mm of the variable observation index 1 to 200 observations for each variable Crab variable descriptions FL (frontal lobe size) RW (rear width) CL (carapace length) CW (carapace width) BD (body depth) 5.2 Upload a data file From your crabs projects home page. Click New data set A dialog window will open. Here you can give your data a name (e.g.Crab data) Click on Choose File, browse to your files location and select. Leave the defaults for encoding, separator, and quote types. Click Next tercen will display the column headers (factors) from your file and the data type (e.g character, numeric) it has detected. Click OK (The Next button will take you to the wide to longconversion wizard. This isn’t necessary as the crabs sample data is already in long format.) You will now see the new data set listed on the project home page. You have successfully uploaded the sample data to Tercen. Next… create a new workflow. "]
