["upload-data.html", "Chapter 5 Upload data About the example data Upload a data file", " Chapter 5 Upload data In this section you will copy some sample data and upload it to your project. Tercen accepts data in the following file types. File Description .tsv Tab Separated Values .csv Comma Separated Values Data can be uploaded in either wide format or long format. Most people work in a Wide data format. Usually with samples in rows and individual measurements in columns. This is the most typical way we use a spreadsheet program. For large data sets, with many multiples of measurement criteria, this can become unwieldy. It is often necessary to convert from a more “people friendly” wide format to a more “machine friendly” long format. Tercen works in long format and will convert wide format data to long during the upload process. About the example data The example data set is available online in a Tercen github repository. Right click on this link –&gt; Sample File and select Save link as... This will download a file to your computer called crabs_long.csv Crab data description: The data set is called Crabs and it is in a long format. The file contains 1000 measurements of crab physical traits. Data is recorded under six headings (called factors). Factor Description sp Species, B (Blue Crab) or O (Orange Crab) sex M (Male) or F (Female) index Index 1 to 50 within each of the four groups (2 sex and 2 species) variable Five crab physical traits can be measured FL, RW, CL, CW and BD measurement The value in mm of the variable observation A crab specimen. Index 1-200 measurements of each variable Crab variable descriptions FL (frontal lobe size) RW (rear width) CL (carapace length) CW (carapace width) BD (body depth) Upload a data file From your crabs project home page. Click New data set A dialog window will open. Give your data a name (e.g.Crab data) Click on Choose File Browse to your file location and select it. Leave the defaults for encoding, separator, and quote types. Click Next Tercen will display the column headers (factors) it has detected from your file and the data type (e.g character, numeric) it has detected in the rows. Click OK (The Next button would take you to the wide to longconversion wizard. This isn’t necessary as the Crabs sample data is already in long format.) You will now see the new data set listed on the project home page. You have successfully uploaded the sample data to Tercen. Next… create a new workflow. "],
["create-a-workflow.html", "Chapter 6 Create a workflow", " Chapter 6 Create a workflow In this section you will create a workflow for your project. From your Crabs Project home page Click on New workflow Name the workflow (e.g. “Crabs workflow”) Click OK You will be taken to the empty workflow builder screen. It is titled “Crabs workflow”. We will now add a workflow step The first step to any workflow will be the Data Table that was uploaded. Add a step to a workflow Right click the workflow builder screen. Select Add Click on Table Select the Crab data Click on OK You will see a box called Crabs Data created on your workflow. You have now successfully imported the crabs data set into the projects workflow. (Note that it shows the Table icon in the top left corner.) The box that you added to the workflow is called a step Steps are the fundamental building blocks of a data analysis process. Right click a step and the long menu appears. The following actions can be performed on a step from the long menu. Action Description Reset Clears any calculations performed on the data. Edit Takes you to the projection page of the step. Rename Change the step name to something more descriptive. Remove Delete this step. Duplicate Copy the step to make a differant visualisation. Add Create a new step which will use the outputs from this step. Saving Workflows As you make changes to a workflow and perform calculations Tercen will prompt you to save your work by displaying a disk icon beside the name of the workflow. It is recommended you save your work often. Next… make a visual projection of your data. "],

In this section we will… Add a data analysis step to our workflow. Review the projection screen. Assign factors to make a projection of the data. Visualize our projection as a Heatmap. Add an analysis Data Step Right click on the Data Table step to bring up the long menu. Click Add Select Data Step Click Ok You will be taken to the Cross-tab Projection Screen Understanding the Cross-tab Projection Screen The projection screen is made up of zones which display data or allow it to be manipulated. The first two to understand are the factors list and the projection grid. Factors are the individual categories of your data which can be manipulated into a visualisation. A Factor can be a variable in the data you uploaded or the results of a computation performed on it. Click on the + icon beside Crabs Data You will see the factors listed are the headers of the sample data file we uploaded. The Projection Grid The projection grid is where visualisations are created and displayed. There are four divisions to the projection grid. X-Axis Y-Axis Column Row By adding factors to these zones a projection is created and visualisations are made from it. Factors are added by drag-and-drop from the list. Definition Controls In the central tab of the projection screen is the definitions zone. Drag and Drop factors to the tab name to configure how data is represented on the visualisation. Zone Description Label Additional description or seperation applied to a factor. Colours Control visualisations by assigning colors to values Error Bar Shows margin of error on calculations (e.g Standard Deviation) Make a projection of the Crabs Data Drag and drop factors to zones on the projection grid as follows. observation to column measurement to y-axis variable to row Re-size your visualisation by grabbing the grid lines and dragging them closer together. Notice, the variable factor is the row and the observations are the columns. By default Tercen will sort data from low to high values. We have visualised the 5 measurements (rows) against the 200 crab specimens columns. Configure the data visualisation as a Heatmap By changing control settings the data projection can be visualised on different ways. Drag and drop the Measurement factor to the Colors zone. A gradient is formed based on the values in the data The higher values are assigned the “hot” colors and the lower ones “cold” colors. Change the visualisation setting from point to heatmap. Because We assigned Observation toColumn the specimens are listed across from 1 to 200. The Heatmap appears to divide them into four groups but this is purely visual. It happened because the uploaded data was pre-sorted into groups (Blue-Male Blue-Female Orange-Male and Orange-Female. The Heatmap is not performing a grouping on the Observation field. Congratulations, you have created your first Heatmap visual. Next… analyze the data by performing a PCA "],
["add-the-pca-operator.html", "Chapter 8 Add the PCA Operator", " Chapter 8 Add the PCA Operator As we saw in the previous chapter data projections can be visualised in various ways. They can also have computations performed on them. The results of these computations are “new data” now available for further visualisations. This is done in later steps of the workflow. In this Chapter you will perform a Principle Component Analysis on the sample Crabs data. Add the PCA Operator to the projection The projection screen has a zone where Operators are added. Click + Select the PCA operator (Recall that you previously added this to the Library in Chapter 3) Click on Run to activate the operator Don’t forget to save your workflow. A PCA has now been calculated on the data. Another data step will be needed to view it’s results. Managing Steps on the Workflow Screen It is important to take the time to label steps correctly. This organises your workflow in ways it can be easily understood. Return to the workflow page Right click on your data step Choose Rename and type “PCA” to identify this step. A green dot appears in the top right corner. This is to tell you that the calculation has been performed. You can clear your calculations, or re-run them, using the long menu. Steps can be dragged into new positions to make your workflow more readable. Next… visualise the results of the PCA computation. "],

In Tercen both the original data, and the computation results, are passed to the “child” step. In this Chapter we will visualize the output of the PCA computation. We will use two of the results (Principal Components) in a pair-wise plot. Add a new data step From the workflow builder screen. Right Click on the PCA data step to access the long menu Select Add Choose Data Step The projection screen will open. You will see it is a copy of the “parent” data step PCA with a new set of factors The new factors are the results of the previous PCA computation step. The results (Principle Components) are labeled PC1 to PC5. PCs are a number of uncorrelated variables, a score, used to identify clusters of data. Click the + icon to view the new list of factors. Use PCA results in a new visualisation To create a new visualisation we must first remove the previous one. Click the small X which appears in the corners of the projection grid divisions. The resulting view should be an empty projection To create the a new pair-wise projection drag and drop the following factors: PCA ds0.PC2 to X-Axis PCA ds0.PC3 to Y-Axis Crabs Data sex to Colors Crabs Data sp to Colors Save the workflow. This creates a visualisation of the PCA results (PC2 and PC3) in a pairwise plot. It is color coded to show the main sex/species groupings.
