["index.html", "Crabs Tutorial Chapter 1 Introduction", " Crabs Tutorial Tercen support document Chapter 1 Introduction This step-by-step guide outlines how to upload, view, compute and share data using Tercen. It uses a multivariate example data set of morphological measurements of two species of Leptograpsus Crabs collected at Fremantle, W. Australia (see Mahon 1974). Why read this guide? : It is the easiest and quickest path to understanding the basics of Tercen. Acknowledgement: I would like to thank all the users for their feedback. It has helped us improve Tercen. Feedback: If you wish to give feedback then please do not hesitate to create an entry in the issue tracker. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering these services we believe biologists get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: Tercen empowers the biologist and liberates the bioinformatician. "],

["upload-the-data.html", "Chapter 6 Upload the data", " Chapter 6 Upload the data In this section we upload the crabs dataset to your teams project. Tercen accepts data in either .tsv or csv. The example data set crabs_longformat.csv is in a .csv format and is in a long format. On the bottom of this section we will show the differences between a long format and a _wide format. Also we provide you with the example dataset’s download location, which you will use for this guide. The Example dataset: The data set for this guide is available online as a git hub repository. Go to the file, by clicking on the following git hub address: (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tercen/starters-guide2/master/data/crabs_longformat.csv) Once it opens, right click and select Save as... Save your data on your desktop. Use the default name (it should be crabs_longformat.csv). Crab data description: The data set is called “Crabs” and it is in a long format. It has a total of 1000 measurements of crab physical traits. It is composed of four groups (two sexes and two species) of 50 measurements for five traits variables, FL (frontal lobe size in mm), RW (rear width mm), CL (carapace length mm), CW (carapace width mm) and BD (body depth mm). In summary it is: Factor values sp species, B or O for Blue or Orange. sex M or F index index 1 to 50 within each of the four groups, 2 sex and 2 species variable one of five variables: FL, RW, CL, CW and BD measurement the value of one of the five variable observation index 1 to 200 observations for each variable Navigate to your projects homepage. Click on New data set A dialog window opens which allows you to select the data file’s location. * Enter Crab data as the name for the data * Click on Choose File and select your file’s location (i.e. “C:\\data\\papercrabs_longformat.csv”). Leave the defaults. Click Next You will see which column headers were detected and the detected data type. Click Next Click OK You will see the new data set in the projects homepage. The difference between a wide format and a long format: In a long format only one measurement is described in a single row, which makes the table very long, hence the name. In a wide format multiple measurements are described in a single row, for example genome data often contains the different samples in the columns. You have successfully uploaded data on to Tercen. In the next section you create a workflow for the analysis of the data. "],

We re-size the image to make all the data viewable Place the mouse on the row lines and drag them closer. Place the mouse on the column lines and drag them closer.

Drag-n-drop the measurement factor to the y-axis zone Drag-n-drop the variable factor to the column zone Drag-n-drop the variable factor to the row zone Drag-n-drop the index factor to the label zone Resize the projection by dragging the row lines tighter, similarly for the columns. Once resized the projection should look like the image below. This is a pairwise projection and it is a direct result of putting the same factor (i.e. variable) on the row and column zone. However this projection can be further developed into a multi-group pairwise. Drag-n-drop the sp factor to the column zone Drag-n-drop the sex factor to the color zone We have now visualized a multi-group pairwise projection. This view is a powerful tool for data visualization.
