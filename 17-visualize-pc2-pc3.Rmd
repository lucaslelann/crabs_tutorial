# Visualize PC2 vs. PC3

In this section we visualize the output of your PCA computation. The visualization uses two principal components in a pair-wise plot.

* Right click on the data step "PCA" and select `Add` 

> I think it is important to explain better why a new step is needed. Also I think we need to spend more time explaining "Why" follow the steps or do these tasks. To help the user with context.

* Select `Data step`
* Open the new `Data step`
 
Looking at the factors on the left of your screen, you will notice there are additional factors in the factor list compared to last section, namely `ds0.PC1`, `ds0.PC2`, etc..

> What are they? Why are they here?

First we require to empty the project by removing factors. Note a tiny x appears when the mouse is placed over the factor zone.
> Explain why do we need to do this.

> Not a text change but functionality question. Should there not be a blank projection grid here because this is a new step. Why did it populate with the choices from the previous step.

* Hover over the zones
* Click on the `x` to clear the zone, repeat for every zone  

The result view should be an empty projection

Now you create the required projection:

* Drag-n-drop the ``ds0.PC2`` factor to the _x-axis zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``ds0.PC3`` factor to the _y-axis zone_
* Drag-n-drop the ``sex`` and ``sp`` factors to the _colors zone_

> Differentiate the groups the factors are being chosen from.

* Click on `Crabs workflow`to return to the workflow

* Right click on the Data step and select `Rename`

* Rename it to "PC2vsPC3"

* Save workflow by clicking on the save icon besides the "Crabs workflow"  

You visualized PC2 versus PC3. In the next section you gather the PCA results to use them in a multi-group pairwise projection.
