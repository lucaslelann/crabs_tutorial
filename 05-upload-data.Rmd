# Upload data

In this section you will copy some sample data and upload it to your project.

\

__Tercen__ accepts data in the following file types.

File|Description
------|---
__.tsv__ |Tab Separated Values
__.csv__|Comma Separated Values

\

Data can be uploaded in either `wide` format or `long` format.

Most people work in a `Wide` data format. 

Usually with samples in rows and individual measurements in columns. 

This is the most typical way we use a spreadsheet program.

For large data sets, with many multiples of measurement criteria, this can become unwieldy. 

It is often necessary to convert from a more "people friendly" `wide` format to a more "machine friendly" `long` format.

__Tercen__ works in `long` format and will convert `wide` format data to long during the upload process.

\

## About the exmple data.

The example data set is available online in a __Tercen__ github repository. 

Right click on this link --> [__Sample File__](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tercen/crabs_dataset/master/data/crabs_long.csv) and select `Save link as...`

This will download a file to your computer called `crabs_long.csv`

\

The data set is called _Crabs_ and it is in a _long_ format. 

The file contains 1000 measurements of crab physical traits. 

Data is recorded under six headings (called __factors__).

\

Factor|Description
------|---
sp |Species, __B__ (<span style="color:blue">Blue Crab</span>) or __O__ (<span style="color:orange">Orange Crab</span>) 
sex|__M__ (Male) or __F__ (Female)
index|Index 1 to 50 within each of the four groups (2 sex and 2 species)
variable|Five crab physical traits can be measured `FL`, `RW`, `CL`, `CW` and `BD`
measurement| The value in mm of the `variable`
observation| A crab specimen. Index 1-200 measurements of each variable

`RW` (rear width)\
`CL` (carapace length)\
`CW` (carapace width)\
`BD` (body depth)\

## Upload a data file


From your crabs project home page. 

\

\

Click `New data set`

A dialog window will open.

\

Give your data a name (e.g.`Crab data`)

Click on `Choose File` 

Browse to your file location and select it.

Leave the defaults for encoding, separator, and quote types.

Click `Next`

\

\

__Tercen__ will display the column headers (factors) it has detected from your file and the data type (e.g character, numeric) it has detected in the rows.

\

Click `OK`

\

_(The `Next` button would take you to the `wide to long`conversion wizard. This isn't necessary as the Crabs sample data is already in long format.)_

\

You will now see the new data set listed on the project home page.
