# Upload data

In this section you will copy some sample data and upload it to your project.

\
The example data set is available online in a __Tercen__ github repository. 

Right click on this link --> [__Sample File__](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tercen/crabs_dataset/master/data/crabs_long.csv) and select `Save link as...`

This will download a file to your computer called `crabs_long.csv`

## About the example data {-}

__Crab data description:__

\

The data set is called _Crabs_ and it is in a _long_ format. 

Long format means that each row of data is a single measurement rather than an individual crab.

The file contains 1000 records. 

200 Crabs where 5 physical traits each were measured

Data is recorded under five headings (called __factors__).

\

Factor|Description
------|---
observation| A crab specimen. Numbered 1-200
Color |__B__ (<span style="color:blue">Blue Crab</span>) or __O__ (<span style="color:orange">Orange Crab</span>) 
sex|__M__ (Male) or __F__ (Female)
variable|Five crab physical traits can be measured `FL`, `RW`, `CL`, `CW` and `BD`
measurement| The value in mm of the `variable`


\

__Crab variable descriptions__

`FL` (frontal lobe size)\
`RW` (rear width)\
`CL` (carapace length)\
`CW` (carapace width)\
`BD` (body depth)\

__Tercen__ will display the column headers (factors) it has detected from your file and the data type (e.g character, numeric) it has detected in the rows.

\

Click `OK`

\

_(The `Next` button would take you to the `wide to long`conversion wizard. This isn't necessary as the Crabs sample data is already in long format.)_

\

You will now see the new data set listed on the project home page.
